# Print Overlay Editor

Lightweight HTML+JS tool to place editable text on top of a background image or PDF page, preview, and print.

Usage

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a static server).
- Click the file picker and choose a JPG/PNG or a PDF (first page is used).
- Click `Add Text` to place editable text boxes. Drag to position, double-click to edit.
- Use the small toolbar on each overlay to change color, increase/decrease size, or delete.
- Click `Print / Save as PDF` to open a print preview (use system print to save as PDF).

Notes

- For PDFs, the first page is rendered using pdf.js from CDN.
- The app is intentionally minimal and runs fully in the browser.
