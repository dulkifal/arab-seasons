# Arab Season Print Order Form

A dynamic and printable HTML form for Arab Season job orders. 

You do not need an internet connection or any complex PDF editing software to use it. It is entirely self-contained.

## How to use

1. Double-click the `print-order.html` file to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).
2. The **Date** will automatically fill in with today's date, but you can click on it to change it.
3. Click on the fields (Name, Sl.no, Description, Remark) to directly type into them.
4. **Images**: You can add images into the Description column. Just drag any image file from your computer and drop it directly onto the Description box.
5. You can resize images by holding and dragging the green handle in their bottom-right corner.

## How to Print or Save

Once the form is completely filled out:
1. Press `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P` on Mac) to open the print menu.
2. In the Print Dialog settings, **ensure "Background Graphics" is turned on** so that the geometric green corners print correctly.
3. The interface elements like dotted lines and image resize handles will magically disappear on the printed page.
4. From here you can either send it to your physical printer or select **"Save as PDF"**.
